/// A trait for writing a given type to a writer
/// 
/// # Examples
///
/// Suppose you and your team are working on a cutting edge database based
/// around set theory with a nice query language, but there exists a need to implement a codec 
/// to capture all of the standard library types â€” and yeet them across the network so that
/// speakers of the "Snek" language can serialize your response.
/// 
/// For starters, there might be some arbitrary constants:
/// ```
/// pub const UUID  = 0x100;
/// pub const STR   = 0x101;
/// pub const BYTES = 0x102;
/// pub const INT16 = 0x103;
/// pub const INT32 = 0x104;
/// pub const INT64 = 0x105;
/// pub const FLOAT32 = 0x106;
/// pub const FLOAT64 = 0x107;
/// pub const DECIMAL = 0x108;
/// pub const BOOL         = 0x109;
/// pub const DATETIME_FFI = 0x10a;
/// pub const DATETIME     = 0x10b;
/// pub const DATE         = 0x10c;
/// pub const TIME         = 0x10d;
/// pub const DURATION     = 0x10e;
/// pub const REL_DURATION = 0x111;
